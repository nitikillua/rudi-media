The AI engineer successfully transitioned the user's initial request from WordPress to a React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack. The development trajectory showcases an iterative process of building core features, incorporating user feedback, and systematically addressing bugs. Key decisions included leveraging Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for a modern frontend, and initially planning for SendGrid before adapting to Formspree for contact form functionality.

A significant part of the work involved refining UI/UX elements, such as custom cursor animations, scroll-triggered effects, and a responsive layout. The AI consistently used  for initial implementation and then  for granular changes. Debugging deployment issues (e.g., GitHub synchronization, Vercel caching) was also a notable part of the interaction, requiring the AI to guide the user on external platform configurations. The current state has a fully functional static frontend, with dynamic parts (like the blog) relying on a static fallback and a contact form needing an auto-confirmation solution.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement an auto-confirmation email for the contact form using EmailJS, as Formspree's free tier lacks this feature.
-   Deploy the FastAPI backend to Vercel to enable dynamic loading of blog posts and full email functionality (separate from Formspree's direct submission).

<current_work>
The Rudi-Media website is a professional, sales-oriented single-page application built with React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, and Framer Motion. The frontend is visually complete, featuring a custom cursor, scroll-triggered animations (fade-in-up, staggered), and a counter-up effect for key metrics. Branding is robust with the user's SVG logo for favicon and social media previews, and an authentic desk photo in the Expertise section.

All content sections (Hero, Why Rudi Media, Services, Contact) are implemented. The Über uns section has been moved to a dedicated page with its own route and content. The blog section displays 6 articles, but these are currently loaded from a static fallback within the frontend because the FastAPI backend, which would provide dynamic content, is not yet deployed to Vercel. Users can navigate the blog overview and read individual articles.

The contact form is integrated with Formspree (ID: ) and successfully sends emails to  upon submission. However, the automatic confirmation email to the customer is currently not functional due to a limitation of Formspree's free plan. The AI has offered EmailJS as a recommended alternative to resolve this. Navigation behavior has been refined so that links to full pages (Home, About, Blog) scroll to the top, while links to sections on the homepage (Services, Contact) correctly scroll to their respective anchor points without jumping to the top. The favicon implementation has been enhanced for better compatibility across browsers and platforms, although Google's caching might cause a delay in displaying the updated icon in search results.
